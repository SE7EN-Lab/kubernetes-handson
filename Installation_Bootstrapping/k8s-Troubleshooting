Troubleshooting k8s
Error: The connection to the server was refused - did you specify the right host or port? 
1. Current user must have kubeconfiguration file set 
2. check docker service running
3. check kubelet service running
4. Check kubelet service logs => journalctl -xeu kubelet
4.1 if errors "node not found. failed: open /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf: no such file or directory", check systemd-resolved.service is running and enabled
5. Check TCP port 6443 is listening
6.  If TCP port isn't availble, check firewall/iptables rules.
