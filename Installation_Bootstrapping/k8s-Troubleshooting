Error: The connection to the server was refused - did you specify the right host or port? 
1. Current user must have kubeconfiguration file set 
2. check docker service running
3. check kubelet service running
4. Check kubelet service logs => journalctl -xeu kubelet
4.1 if errors "node not found. failed: open /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf: no such file or directory", check systemd-resolved.service is running and enabled
5. Check TCP port 6443 is listening

Application Failure
1. Follow bottom-up approach investigation - pod to service
Most used command:
kubectl -n <namespace> get all -o wide --show-labels

Network failure:
1. Check for service endpoints using kubectl get ep <service-name>
2. Check the status of Pod nework.
3. Check the status of Kube-proxy and CoreDNS.
4. Get into a pod and launch nslookup a service name to confirm DNS resolution.

Topics to cover:
1.kubectl custom-columns

2. Create a pod called secret-1401 in the admin1401 namespace using the busybox image. The container within the pod should be called secret-admin and should sleep for 4800 seconds.

The container should mount a read-only secret volume called secret-volume at the path /etc/secret-volume. The secret being mounted has already been created for you and is called dotfile-secret.
